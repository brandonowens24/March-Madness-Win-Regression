# March Madness Win Regression

* This small project was completed for **STA 5002: Applied Linear Models I**.
* This project looks to take input variables from NCAAM College Basketball Teams and use them to predict the number of WINS a team will have during a March Madness Tournament.
 * Utilization of R for Data Merging and SAS for Regression Analysis

## Findings
* See `Simple Linear Regression-March Madness.pdf` for complete breakdown.
